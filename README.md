*Eschecs* is a chess playing program, using the [UCI protocol](http://www.shredderchess.com/chess-info/features/uci-universal-chess-interface.html) to dialog with a chess engine.

## I. User's Guide

### A. Moving a piece

To move a piece, drag it with the mouse to the target square.

### B. Artificial Chess Player

A default chess engine is loaded at application start.

You can select another opponent in a list of chess engines. See the "Moves" menu.

### C. Play Mode

The default play mode is user versus computer, user playing white.

If you wish the computer to play white, click on "Computer move".

To play in human versus human mode, uncheck the "Autoplay" option in the "Moves" menu. 

### E. Keyboard Controls

    ↑   Go to the last position
    ↓   Go back to the first position
    ←   Go back to the previous position
    →   Go to the next position
    ESC Close the application

## II. Advanced User's Guide

### A. Installation of a new UCI engine

To install a new engine, you have to edit **eschecs.eng**. That file stands in the **config** directory.

### B. Protocol

*Eschecs* uses the UCI protocol.

For the "go" command, *Eschecs* uses the following syntax:

    go movetime 1000

You can change the value of the parameter by editing **eschecs.ini**, which stands in the **config** directory.

## III. Programmer's Guide

### A. Compilation

*Eschecs* is an open source program for the Free Pascal Compiler.

*Eschecs* uses [fpGUI][1], [BGRABitmap][2] and [uos][3] libraries.

There are three methods to compile *Eschecs*.

You can use the script *build.cmd* (for Windows) or *build.sh* (for Linux). Free Pascal must be installed on your system.

You can use the [Lazarus](https://sourceforge.net/projects/lazarus/) project files *eschecs.lpi* and *options.lpi*. There are, indeed, two applications to compile.

You can also use the [MSEide](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mseide-msegui/) project files *eschecs.prj* and *options.prj*.

### B. Sound library binaries installation

Once the application is compiled, you need to download the binaries of the uos library, and install them in the *audio* directory, so that if you OS is (for example) Windows 64, the uos binaries will be in *<eschecs>\audio\lib\Windows\64bit* directory.

You can download uos library binaries [here](https://github.com/fredvs/uos/releases/).

### C. Engines and configuration file.

Finally, you need one or several UCI engines. To install your engines, you need to edit with your favourite text editor the file *eschecs.eng* in the *config* directory. Of course, in the release packages, some engines are already included and installed.
